# Business-Development-Analysis

ðŸ”¹ Introduction

This project focuses on analyzing business development activities using Power BI. It consolidates sales offers, order values, and salesperson/district performance into interactive dashboards. The analysis enables management to track trends, monitor order statuses, and make data-driven decisions for business growth.

ðŸ”¹ Problem Statement

The organization receives large volumes of offers and orders across multiple salespersons and districts. However, the lack of consolidated analysis creates challenges:

Difficulty in identifying top-performing salespersons and districts.

Limited visibility into order statuses (budgetary, live, lost, received, etc.).

Inability to track monthly/quarterly trends in offers and orders.

Lack of interactive tools for real-time monitoring and decision-making.

ðŸ”¹ Skills Demonstrated

Data Cleaning & Integration â€“ preparing structured datasets from raw business development records.

Business Analysis â€“ evaluating offers, orders, and district-wise performance.

Data Visualization (Power BI) â€“ creating interactive dashboards with KPIs and filters.

Trend Analysis â€“ monitoring monthly and quarterly patterns for forecasting.

Stakeholder Reporting â€“ translating data into actionable business insights.

ðŸ”¹ Analysis

Key insights derived from the analysis include:

Offers through Salespersons: Distribution and performance comparison among individuals.

District-Wise Offers: Chennai, Coimbatore, Tirupur, Dindigul, and Erode performance breakdown.

Order Values & Quantities: Conversion of offers into actual orders.

Order Status Tracking: Categorization into budgetary, expected, live, lost, and revised tenders.

Monthly & Quarterly Trends: Visualization of fluctuations in offer values over time.

The Power BI dashboards provide drill-down capabilities, enabling management to track performance at salesperson, district, and time-period levels.
